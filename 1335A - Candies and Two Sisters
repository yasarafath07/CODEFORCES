eg1: For n=2, we can't distribute to 2 sisters (print 0)
eg2: For n=3, we can distribute 2 candies (a) to sister1 and 1 candies (b) to sister 2. So, here a>b. So when n=3, we have 1 way (print 1)
eg3: For n=4, we have a=3 (for sister 1) and b=1 (for sister 2). So, 1 way (print 1)
eg4: For n=5, we have a=4 (for sister 1) and b=1 (for sister 2) which is 1st way and the 2nd way is a=3 and b=2 (so, print 2)
