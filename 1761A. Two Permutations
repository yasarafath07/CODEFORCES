// What is  Permutation of length n?
// It is an Array of size n means there are n elements in it and it has all the elements from 1 to n exactly once in it. and it's position 
// can be anything.
/*eg: [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation of size 5. but [1,2,2] is not a permutation since 2 is repeated.
Similarly, [1,2,3,4,6] is not a permutation since here n = 5 and there is 6 in the array.
